# Test plan — Payment Request API

This document provides specific information about testing related to the
Payment Request API spec.

## Editing Policy as of Candidate Recommendation

All PRs with normative changes to the spec source must have a corresponding PR in
[the web-platform-tests Payment Request API test suite](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/payment-request)
— either adding new tests or modifying existing tests — or else must include in the PR
commit message an explanation why tests aren’t needed for the spec change.

Typically, both the PR for a spec change and the PR for the associated tests will be merged
around the same time. If the spec PR is approved but the tests PR needs more work, add the
[`needs tests`](https://w3c.github.io/spec-labels.html) label to the spec PR. Or if the
tests PR is approved but the spec PR hasn’t yet been OK’ed, add the
[`status:needs-spec-decision`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Astatus%3Aneeds-spec-decision%20)
label to the tests PR.

Note that a test change which doesn’t conform to the current spec source on the `gh-pages`
branch should not be merged before the corresponding spec change is merged to `gh-pages`.

If testing a particular spec change isn’t practical due to web-platforms-tests limitations,
explain why in the spec-PR commit message, file a
[wpt issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues)
describing the limitation, and add the
[`type:untestable`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Atype%3Auntestable%20)
label to the issue.

## Running the Payment Request Test Suite

Run the Payment Request API tests in a browser to check whether the browser passes the tests. So the tests are essentially browser tests—browser-conformance tests. See the (not yet very useful) [dashboard](https://wptdashboard.appspot.com/payment-request).

See [existing tests for the Payment Request API](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/payment-request), which are also available on a [mirror](https://w3c-test.org/payment-request).

## Contributing to the Test Suite

### Desired Skillset

- skill in JavaScript

- general understanding about how JavaScript works in browsers (the
  execution model, the event loop, etc.)

- general understanding of core JavaScript APIs for the web runtime—for
  example, DOM APIs and the async nature of most of those APIs

- some existing experience with doing browser testing

### web-platform-tests

The Payment Request API tests are part of [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/) (WPT). We rely on `git` as our version-control mechanism, so we seek contributors who ideally have some general familiarity/experience in working with `git` (but that’s not a hard requirement—you can learn `git` as you go). The general how-to docs for WPT contributors are at http://web-platform-tests.org/; the [README](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/README.md) has some other high-level getting-started info.

### testharness.js

The core of the test infrastructure is a JavaScript-based test harness called _`testharness.js`_; see the [documentation](http://web-platform-tests.org/writing-tests/testharness-api.html). For contributors, understanding how `testharness.js` works and how to write tests using it is the most important requirement.

### Getting Help

The best place for contributors to ask questions and get help quickly is on the IRC channel `#testing` on the [`irc.w3.org`](http://irc.w3.org/) server. We also use the mailing list `public-test-infra@w3.org`, which contributors can subscribe to by sending a message with `Subject: Subscribe` to `public-test-infra-request@w3.org`.

# Notes from Ian who set things up
* Cloned https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt
* Edited Hosts file per the [README](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/README.md)
* Start local server by running web-platform-tests/wpt serve
* To test in Chrome on Mac desktop, enabled "experiment web features" in about:config.
* Open http://localhost:8000/payment-request/
* Filenames matter (e.g., https in payment-request-show-method.https.html).
* Look at existing test files for how they reference testharness.js and testharnessreport.js. The latter relates to machine readable reporting.
